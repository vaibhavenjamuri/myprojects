## Project Title
Planet Tree System

## Context:
“PlanetTree” is a non-profit organization which promotes the planting of trees throughout the region.
Currently serving Missouri, the organization looks forward to nationwide expansion. PlanetTree
works with municipal governments, state agencies and, in some cases, private land owners to place
trees. All trees are funded through donations and are planted by volunteers. The administrator
compares contributed tree funds with requests to determine monthly planting events.
## Business Problem:
As a non-profit organization with no revenue to cover administrative costs, the administrator works as
a non-paid volunteer. Effective and efficient use of time for communication and coordination with
volunteers is required if the organization is to continue in its current structure.
## Project Purpose:
A web site will be used to facilitate communication and coordination between these parties.
